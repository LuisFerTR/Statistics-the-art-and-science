## Exercises
**1.1 Aspirin the wonder drug** An analysis by Professor Peter
M Rothwell and his colleagues (Nuffield Department of
Clinical Neuroscience, University of Oxford, UK) published
in 2012 in the medical journal The Lancet (http://www.
thelancet.com) assessed the effects of daily aspirin intake
on cancer mortality. They looked at individual patient data
from 51 randomized trials (77,000 participants) of daily intake of aspirin versus no aspirin or other anti-platelet agents.
According to the authors, aspirin reduced the incidence of
cancer, with maximum benefit seen when the scheduled duration of trial treatment was five years or more and resulted
in a relative reduction in cancer deaths of about 15% (562  cancer deaths in the aspirin group versus 664 cancer deaths in the Control group). Specify the aspect of this study that pertains to (a) design, (b) description, and (c) inference.

#### Ans. 
  a. Design: They looked at individual patient data
from 51 randomized trials (77,000 participants) of daily intake of aspirin versus no aspirin or other anti-platelet agents.
  b.  Description: duration of trial treatment was five years or more and resulted
in a relative reduction in cancer deaths of about 15% (562  cancer deaths in the aspirin group versus 664 cancer deaths in the Control group)
  c. Inference: According to the authors, aspirin reduced the incidence of
cancer, with maximum benefit seen when the scheduled duration of trial treatment was five years or more

**1.2 Poverty and age** The Current Population Survey (CPS)
is a survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. It provides a comprehensive
body of data on the labor force, unemployment, wealth,
poverty, and so on. The data can be found online at
www.census.gov/cps/. The 2014 CPS ASEC (Annual
Social and Economic Supplement) had redesigned questions for income that were implemented to a sample of
approximately 30,000 addresses that were eligible to
receive these. The report indicated that 21.1% of children under 18 years, 13.5% of people between 18 to 64
years, and 10.0% of people 65 years and older were below the poverty line. Based on these results, the report
concluded that the percentage of all people between
the ages of 18 to 64 in poverty lies between 13.2% and 13.8%. Specify the aspect of this study that pertains to (a) description and (b) inference.

#### Ans.
  a. Description: The report indicated that 21.1% of children under 18 years, 13.5% of people between 18 to
     64 years, and 10.0% of people 65 years and older were below the poverty line.
  b. Inference: Based on these results, the report concluded that the percentage of all people between
     the ages of 18 to 64 in poverty lies between 13.2% and 13.8%.
     
**1.3 GSS and heaven** Go to the General Social Survey
website, http://sda.berkeley.edu/GSS. Enter HEAVEN
as the row variable and then click Run the Table. When
asked whether they believed in heaven, what percentage
of those surveyed said yes, definitely; yes, probably; no,
probably not; and no, definitely not?

#### Ans.
  - yes, definitely 64.6%
  - yes, probably 20.8%
  - no, probably 8.7%
  - no, definitely 5.9%

```


**1.4 GSS and heaven and hell** Refer to the previous
exercise. You can obtain data for a particular survey
year such as 2008 by entering YEAR(2008) in the
Selection Filter option box before you click Run
the Table.

- **a.** Do this for HEAVEN in 2008, giving the percentages
for the four possible outcomes. Note that HEAVEN
is not available for the 2014 data because the question
wasn’t asked that year.

- **b.**Summarize opinions in 2008 about belief in hell (row
variable HELL). Was the percentage of “yes, definitely”
responses higher for belief in heaven or in hell?

#### Ans.
- **a.** 

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h!]

```

- **b.**

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{"./do_you_believe_in_hell_2008.png"}
  \vspace{-0.5cm}
  \caption{Do you believe in. . . c. hell? 2008}
  \label{fig:Do you believe in. . . c. hell? 2008}
\end{figure}
```
  
  The answer "yes, definitely" has higher percentage of responses for belief in heaven than belief in hell
  
**1.5 GSS for subject you pick** At the GSS website, click
Standard Codebook under Codebooks and then
click Sequential Variable List. Find a subject that
 interests you and look up a relevant GSS code name
to enter as the row variable. Summarize the results that
you obtain.

#### Ans.
The variable of my interest was "HELPFUL", this variable is measured by the following question " Would you say that most of the time people try to be 
helpful, or that they are mostly just looking out for 
themselves?"
