## Exercises
**1.6 Description and inference**
  a. Distinguish between description and inference as
reasons for using statistics. Illustrate the distinction
using an example.
  b. You have data for a population, such as obtained in a
census. Explain why descriptive statistics are helpful
but inferential statistics are not needed.

#### Ans.
  a. We use descriptive statistics when we want to summarize and illustrate features of our data. By the other hand, inferential statistics is used when we need to make a prediction or use estimate population characteristics based on sample data. For example, we can collect data about school education levels and summarized how many people have a high school diploma, drop college, have a bachelor's degree or PhD, these data can be plotted in a bar plot, that is descriptive statistics; inferential statistics will look the data to make conclusions.
  
  b. Descriptive statistics will help us summarizing the characteristics of the census answers, giving us plots easy to understand and letting us know the big picture about the sample. Inferential is not necessary as long as we don't want to make conclusiones about related topics in the census.

**1.7 Ebook use** During the spring semester in 2014, an ebook survey was administered to students of Winthrop University. Of the 170 students sampled, 45% indicated
that they had used ebooks for their academic work.
Identify (a) the sample, (b) the population, and (c) the
sample statistic reported.

#### Ans.
  a. 170
  b. All registered students in Winthrop University
  c. 45%
  
**1.8 Concerned about global warming?** The Institute
for Public Opinion Research at Florida International
University has conducted the [FIU/Florida Poll](www2
.fiu.edu/orgs/ipor/globwarm2.html) of about 1200
Floridians annually since 1988 to track opinions on a wide
variety of issues. In 2006 the poll asked, “How concerned
are you about the problem of global warming?” The possible responses were very concerned, somewhat concerned,
not very concerned, and haven’t heard about it. The poll
reported percentages (44, 30, 21, 6) in these categories.
a. Identify the sample and the population.
b. Are the percentages quoted statistics or parameters? Why?

#### Ans.
  a. Sample: 1200, Population: People living in Florida.
  b. The percentages are statistics because they are summaries of a sample taken from a population.
  
**1.9 Preferred holiday destination** Suppose a student is interested in knowing the preferred holiday destinations of
the faculty members in his university. He is affiliated to
the college of business and interviews a few of the faculty
members of this college about their preferred holiday
destination. In this context, identify the (a) subject, (b)
sample, and (c) population.

#### Ans.
  a. Each faculty member in the college of business. 
  b. The faculty members interviewed.
  c. All faculty members in the college of business. 
  
**1.10 Is globalization good?** The Voice of the People poll
asks a random sample of citizens from different countries around the world their opinion about global issues.
Included in the list of questions is whether they feel that
globalization helps their country. The reported results
were combined by regions. In the most recent poll, 74%
of Africans felt globalization helps their country, whereas
38% of North Americans believe it helps their country.
(a) Identify the samples and the populations. (b) Are
these percentages sample statistics or population parameters? Explain your answer.

#### Ans.
  a. Samples: Random citizens from different countries. Populations: People living in a country.
  b. Statistics because they are numerical summaries of a sample taken from a population.
  
**1.11 Graduating seniors’ salaries** The job placement center
at your school surveys all graduating seniors at the school.
Their report about the survey provides numerical summaries such as the average starting salary and the percentage
of students earning more than $30,000 a year.
a. Are these statistical analyses descriptive or inferential?
Explain.
b. Are these numerical summaries better characterized as
statistics or as parameters?

#### Ans.
  a. The statistic analysis is descriptive, the reason is that is describing characteristics about the data. 
  b. Parameters because they are numerical summaries of all **population**.

**1.12 At what age did women marry?** A historian wants to
estimate the average age at marriage of women in New
England in the early 19th century. Within her state archives she finds marriage records for the years 1800–
1820, which she treats as a sample of all marriage records
from the early 19th century. The average age of the
women in the records is 24.1 years. Using the appropriate
statistical method, she estimates that the average age of
brides in early 19th-century New England was between
23.5 and 24.7.
  a. Which part of this example gives a descriptive summary of the data?
  b. Which part of this example draws an inference about a population?
  c. To what population does the inference in part b refer?
  d. The average age of the sample was 24.1 years. Is 24.1 a statistic or a parameter?
  
#### Ans.
  a. "The average age of the women in the records is 24.1 years"
  b. "she estimates that the average age of brides in early 19th-century New England was between 23.5 and 24.7."
  c. All married woman in 19th century.
  d. 24.1 is a statistic. The numerical summary is of a sample taken from a population.
  
1.13 Age pyramids as descriptive statistics The figure shown
is a graph published by Statistics Sweden. It compares
Swedish society in 1750 and in 2010 on the numbers of
men and women of various ages, using age pyramids.  
Explain how this indicates that  
  a. In 1750, few Swedish people were old.  
  b. In 2010, Sweden had many more people than in 1750.  
  c. In 2010, of those who were very old, more were female than male.  
  d. In 2010, the largest five-year group included people born during the era of first manned space flight.

\end{figure}
```

#### Ans.
  a. The top of the pyramid are small bars, the bar length indicates the people which belong to that age range
  b. The maximum bars' length in 2010 is greater than 1750 in all age ranges
  c. The top bar indicates the very old people, females' bar is greater than males' bar.
  d. From the plot, the largest bars are from people between 45-49.
  
**1.14 Gallup polls** Go to the website www.galluppoll.com for
the Gallup poll. From reports listed on its home page, give
an example of (a) a descriptive statistical analysis and
(b) an inferential statistical analysis.

#### Ans.
  a. 21% of sampled people is satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S.
  b. Between 41% and 46% of U.S. adults approve of the way the president is handling 
  
**1.15 Graduate studies** Consider the population of all undergraduate students at your university. A certain proportion have an interest in graduate studies. Your friend
randomly samples 40 undergraduates and uses the sample
proportion of those who have an interest in graduate studies to predict the population proportion at the university. You conduct an independent study of a random
sample of 40 undergraduates and find the sample proportion of those are interested in graduate studies. For these
two statistical studies,  
a. Are the populations the same?  
b. How likely is it that the samples are the same? Explain.  
c. How likely is it that the sample proportions are equal? Explain.  

#### Ans.
  a. Yes, they are the same
  b. Since the sample were randomly taken, is very unlikely that they are the same.
  c. Thanks to randomness the variability of sample proportions will be small.
  
**1.16 Samples vary less with more data** We’ll see that the
amount by which statistics vary from sample to sample
always depends on the sample size. This important fact
can be illustrated by thinking about what would happen
in repeated flips of a fair coin.  
a. Which case would you find more surprising—flipping
the coin five times and observing all heads or flipping
the coin 500 times and observing all heads?  
b. Imagine flipping the coin 500 times, recording the
proportion of heads observed, and repeating this
experiment many times to get an idea of how much
the proportion tends to vary from one sequence to
another. Different sequences of 500 flips tend to
result in proportions of heads observed which are less
variable than the proportion of heads observed in
sequences of only five flips each. Using part a, explain
why you would expect this to be true.

#### Ans.
  a. The second since both heads and tails have the same probability.
  b. The approximated margin error will be smaller in 500 flips sequences than 5 flips sequences
  
**1.17 Comparing polls** The following table shows the result
of the 2012 presidential election along with the vote
predicted by several organizations in the days before the
election. The sample sizes were typically about 1000 to
2000 people. The percentages for each poll do not sum to
100 because of voters who indicated they were undecided
or preferred another candidate.

```

a. Treating the sample sizes as 1000 each, find the
approximate margin of error.  
b. Do most of the predictions fall within the margin of
error of the actual vote percentages? Considering the
relative sizes of the sample, the population, and the
undecided factor, would you say that these polls had
good accuracy?  

#### Ans.
  a. $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1000}} \times 100\% = 3.2\% $$
  b. Sure, most of the predictions fall within margin of error therefore We can consider them as accurate predictions.
  
**1.18 Margin of error and n** A poll was conducted by Ipsos
Public Affairs for Global News. It was conducted between May 18 and May 20, 2016, with a sample of 1005
Canadians. It was found 73% of the respondents “agree”
that the Liberals should not make any changes to the
country’s voting system without a national referendum
first. (http://globalnews.ca/news/). Find the approximate
margin of error if the poll had been based on a sample of
size (a) n = 900, (b) n = 1600, and (c) n = 2500. Explain
how the margin of error changes as n increases.

#### Ans.
  a. $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{900}} \times 100\% = 3.33\% $$
  b. $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1600}} \times 100\% = 2.5\% $$
  c. $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2500}} \times 100\% = 2\% $$
  As long as n increases the approximate margin of error decreases.
  
**1.19 Smoking cessation** A study published in 2010 in
The New England Journal of Medicine investigated the
effect of financial incentives on smoking cessation. As
part of the study, 878 employees of a company, all of
whom were smokers, were randomly assigned to one of
two treatment groups. One group (442 employees) was to
receive information about smoking cessation programs;
the other (436 employees) was to receive that same information as well as a financial incentive to quit smoking. The outcome of interest of the study was smoking
cessation status six months after the initial cessation was
reported. After implementation of the program, 14.7%
of individuals in the financial incentive group reported
cessation six months after the initial report, compared
to 5.0% of the information-only group. Assume that the
observed difference in cessation rates between the groups
(14.7% - 5.0% = 9.7%) is statistically significant.  
  
  a. What does it mean to be statistically significant? (choose the best option from (i)–(iv))  
    i. The financial option was offered to 9.7% more smokers in the study than the nonsmokers who were employees of the company.  
    ii. 9.7% was calculated using statistical techniques.  
    iii. If there were no true impact of the financial incentive, the observed difference of   9.7% is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.  
    iv. We know that if the financial incentive were given to all smokers, 9.7% would quit smoking.  
    
  b. Is the difference between the groups attributable to the financial incentive?
    
#### Ans.
  a. iii
  b. Yes. Because the workers were separated by groups randomly.
